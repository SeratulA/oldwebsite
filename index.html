                <h2 style="font-size: 36px;">My Projects</h2>
                <h2>ROSP Inc. Startup Project</h2>
                <p1>
                    I was hired as a lead developer to create an invoice app. My team consisted of four members in which
                    we created both a phone
                    and web app. We used Google's Flutter to create both apps and used Google's Firebase as our database
                    to store user information.
                    </p>

                    <p1>
                        Here is a view of the login page on both the phone and web view.
                        </p>
                        <div style="text-align:center;">
                            <img src="Login.jpg" alt="your image description" width="900" height="1050">
                        </div>
                    </p>
                        <p1>
                            This is the home page view for retailers and vendors. This shows all incoming invoices
                            that are due and allowed options to view upcoming and paid invoices in a table format. 
                            While clicking on checkboxes, you can select multiple invoices and pay them.                            </p>
                            <div style="text-align:center;">
                                <img src="Retailer View.jpg" alt="your image description" width="900" height="1050">

                        <p1>
                            Lastly, this was an option to upload all of your previous invoices of a certain file format
                            including csv, xlsx, and txt. After uploading your invoices, you are able to match your uploaded
                            document columns to the fixed format presented by our app.
                            </p>

                    <p1>
                        For this project, I used two API's and created a mashup that uses them synchrnously. The API's I used was weatherbit
                        and citi-bike API's. When a user input's a zipcode, they are provided with all the citi bike stations in the area. 
                        Additionally, information about the address, available bikes, weather, temperature, time of sunrise, and time of 
                        sunset was also provided.
